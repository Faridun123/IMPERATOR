##### As our program grows bigger, it may contain many lines of code. Instead of  putting everything in a single file, you can use modules to separate codes in separate files as per their functionality. This makes our code organized and  easier to maintain

_____
##### Module is a file that contains code to perform a specific task. A module may  contain variables, functions, classes etc. Let's see an example


# Module
##### Suppose, a file named greet.js contains  the following code:
